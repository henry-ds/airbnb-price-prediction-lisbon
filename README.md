# Airbnb Price Prediction – Lisbon

## Project Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict nightly Airbnb
rental prices using real-world European listings data from Lisbon, Portugal.
The analysis follows an end-to-end data science workflow including data
cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, modeling, and
evaluation.

## Dataset
- Source: Inside Airbnb
- City: Lisbon, Portugal
- File: listings.csv

## Methodology
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Feature engineering
4. Regression modeling
5. Model evaluation using RMSE

## Models Used
- Linear Regression (baseline)
- Random Forest Regressor

## Key Findings
- Airbnb prices in Lisbon are right-skewed, with most listings below €200 per night
- Entire homes/apartments command significantly higher prices than private rooms
- Location and room type are the strongest predictors of nightly price
- The Random Forest model outperforms Linear Regression, indicating non-linear relationships in the data

## Tools & Technologies
Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, GitHub, Jupyter Notebook
